# Cariochi Objecto

Objecto is a lightweight Java library designed to simplify and enhance the process of object creation and testing in unit tests. It provides a convenient way to generate complex objects with various configurations, making it easier for developers to focus on testing their logic rather than creating elaborate object setups.

## Features

- **Object Generation**: Easily create instances of complex objects with sensible default values.
- **Parameterized Creation**: Generate objects with specific parameters to suit your testing needs.
- **Type Constructors and Generators**: Define how certain types are constructed or generated to control the creation process.
- **Field Generators**: Customize the generation of specific fields within your objects.
- **Test-Friendly**: Streamline your unit tests by reducing boilerplate code related to object setup.
